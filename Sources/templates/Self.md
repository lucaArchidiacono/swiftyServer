#  About myself

Hello, world! It's rather amusing, isn't it, that this was the first line of code I ever wrote at the start of my career as a software engineer? 

In this introduction, I aim to briefly explain the purpose of this blog and introduce myself. So, what's on the agenda?

In this concise blog of mine, I endeavor to convey my experiences and insights gained throughout my enriching journey as a software engineer. I'll be sharing novel technical subjects and anything else that piques my interest (including topics related to games and movies, given my 'geek' side). It's important to note that while I strive to maintain objectivity in my writing, there's always room for my personal perspective (or as we say in [Schwiizerdütsch](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schweizerdeutsch), "Mihn senf dezue gäh"). So, a gentle reminder to not take everything here too seriously. 

## So, who am I?

To put it briefly, I'm Luca Archidiacono. My career as a software engineer kicked off in 2013 when I was given the opportunity to apprentice at [UBS AG](https://www.ubs.com), which is actually quite common in Switzerland. After a 4-year apprenticeship period (which happened in my 20s), I was fortunate enough to continue my journey at [UBS AG](https://www.ubs.com/), where I significantly developed my skills.

My tenure at [UBS AG](https://www.ubs.com) was a rich learning experience. I acquired knowledge on an array of topics, such as building microservices and frameworks in Java, and creating various iOS apps for internal and client-oriented purposes. Concurrently, while being a part of numerous projects at [UBS AG](https://www.ubs.com), I pursued my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Applied Science ZHAW. The university opened my eyes to a multitude of subjects ranging from algebra to network packets, assembly to machine learning, and artificial intelligence to image processing. I am truly grateful for all the learning opportunities I've had.

At present, I'm working at a startup named [futureLab AG](https://www.futurelab.ch/). Here, I'm involved in developing an iOS app for the police, which incorporates the latest tech stack (async-await, SwiftUI, etc.). 

## But why start a blog?

I believe that by writing this blog, I can assist three distinct groups of people:

1. Myself, by improving my ability to articulate and better retain the knowledge I've recently acquired.
2. The curious visitor who stumbled upon my site while searching for something StackOverflow couldn't assist with.
3. Everyone else who simply enjoys surfing the web and reading the various topics I share.
