# About myself

Hello, world! It's pretty funny, right? "Hello, world!" was the first code I ever wrote when I began my career as a software engineer.

In this introduction, I want to explain what this blog is about and tell you a bit about myself. So, what's the plan?

In this short blog of mine, I'll share my experiences and things I've learned during my journey as a software engineer. I'll talk about technical stuff and anything else that interests me (like games and movies because I'm a bit of a geek). Just a heads up, I'll try to be objective, but sometimes I'll add my personal perspective, like we say in [Schwiizerdütsch](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schweizerdeutsch), "Mihn senf dezue gäh" (giving my two cents). So, don't take everything too seriously, okay?

## So, who am I?

To keep it simple, I'm Luca Archidiacono. My software engineering career began in 2013 when I got a chance to start an apprenticeship at [UBS AG](https://www.ubs.com), which is quite common in Switzerland. After four years of learning the ropes (during my 20s), I got the opportunity to continue at UBS AG and enhance my skills.

My time at UBS AG was a great learning experience. I learned about many things, like building microservices and Java frameworks, and creating iOS apps for different uses. At the same time, I was part of several projects at UBS AG while pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Applied Science ZHAW. The university opened my eyes to a bunch of topics, from algebra to network packets, assembly to machine learning, and artificial intelligence to image processing. I'm really thankful for all the opportunities I had to learn.

Currently, I work at a startup called [futureLab AG](https://www.futurelab.ch/). Here, I'm working on developing an iOS app for the police, using the latest tech stack (async-await, SwiftUI, etc.).

## But why start a blog?

I think this blog can help three different groups of people:

1. Myself, by improving my ability to explain things and remember what I've learned recently.
2. People who are curious and stumbled upon my site while searching for something that even StackOverflow couldn't help with.
3. Everyone else who just likes to browse the web and read about the various topics I share.
